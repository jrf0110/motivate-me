# Motivate Me - Basically a leaderboard type mobile app

This is just a hacked up version of an app I created so my girlfriend and I could keep track of the points we reward each other if we wake the other one up on any given morning.

I used Meteor and Ratchet to build this thing out very quickly. So far, I absolutely love both of them.
